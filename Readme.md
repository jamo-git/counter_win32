# C++ Counter project

### Note! This is merely a personal training project where C++ and win32 GUI plays main part.

The application will run on a window and show current time in `HH:mm:ss` format updating every second. Then there's a input box for additional timer adjust in `HH:mm`format. After pressing `Set` button, the application will update new time to window. The application will give an error if the input is in wrong format. When timer is up, the application will notify the user.
