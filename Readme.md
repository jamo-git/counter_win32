# C++ Counter project

### Note! This is merely a personal training project where C++ and win32 GUI plays main part.

The application will run on a window and show current time in `HH:mm:ss` format updating every second. Then there's a input box for additional timer adjust. After pressing `Set` button, the application will update new time to window.
